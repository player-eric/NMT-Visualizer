# **Overview**

**nmtvis** is an open-source visualization toolkit designed for NMT(Neural Machine Translation) model.

<!--more-->

This versatile and out-of-the-box toolkit aims at helping researchers better understand how their model works, so that they can further adjust or improve the model.

## Installation

Use pip to install **nmtvis**::

      pip install nmtvis

## Requirements

- Python3
- Numpy
